# About

This command displays information about {caelus.name} such as this website, the support server, ways to sponsor, etc. If you're here already, documenting this command is pretty redundant.

Instead, here's a classic:

<iframe
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
	allowFullScreen
	height="500"
	sandbox="allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
	src="https://youtube.com/embed/BB1cIomr-Bc"
	title="YouTube video player"
	width="100%"
/>
