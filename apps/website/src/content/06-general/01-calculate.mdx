There may be a Double Seasonal Light event during calculations. These are taken into account and will be displayed in the footer if a calculation is wthin the dates.

## Winged light

This calculator calculates the amount of winged light one may have. For example, simply stating your wing buffs will reveal how much wing light you should have if all of them were to be obtained.

Selecting realms in the command will only take those realms into consideration in the calculation. This is useful for when you want to check your winged light total after visiting a realm.
