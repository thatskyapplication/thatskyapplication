# Hug

Someone feeling down? Need to share some love? Why not give someone a hug?

That's right! Hugs are Sky-themed!

## Submissions

You can record your own hugging GIF for it to be included in the cycle. Amazing! You must, however, use an iOS device and natively record within Sky. This hides obstructing user interfaces, which are not desired.

Head on over to our <DiscordLink href={INVITE_SUPPORT_SERVER_URL} title="support server" /> for aid!
