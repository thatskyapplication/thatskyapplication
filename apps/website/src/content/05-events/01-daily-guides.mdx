We have:

- The date
- Daily quests
- Treasure candles
- Seasonal candles (if applicable)
- Any shard eruption

This information is extracted from Sky:CoTL Infographics Database. For experienced players, the name of the quests and the availability of a shard eruption are enough to understand what to do for the day. Unfortunately, scrolling through infograhpics to find a specific thing wastes precious time, especially when one does not need a guide, hence a more compact version with links to infographics as a fallback. This also makes it easier to see what's going on at a quick glance.

## Setup

Here's how to get started with getting daily guide notifications in your server. It's super simple. You just need to select a channel!

<DiscordMessages rounded>
	<DiscordMessage
		author={{ avatar: caelus.avatarIcon, bot: true, username: caelus.name }}
		interaction={{ author: { avatar: jiralite.avatarIcon, username: jiralite.name }, command: "/daily-guides setup" }}
	>
		Daily guides have been modified.
		<DiscordMessageEmbed
			title="Skykid Server"
			fields={[{ name: "Daily Guides Status", value: `#daily-guides` }, { name: "✅ Sending!" }]}
		/>
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

Of course, {caelus.name} must have permission to view, send messages, and embed links in the channel.

## Overview

Just in case you wanted to check the status of daily guides in your server, this exists.

<DiscordMessages rounded>
	<DiscordMessage
		author={{ avatar: caelus.avatarIcon, bot: true, username: caelus.name }}
		interaction={{
			author: { avatar: jiralite.avatarIcon, username: jiralite.name },
			command: "/daily-guides overview",
		}}
	>
		Daily guides have been modified.
		<DiscordMessageEmbed
			title="Skykid Server"
			fields={[{ name: "Daily Guides Status", value: `#daily-guides` }, { name: "✅ Sending!" }]}
		/>
	</DiscordMessage>
</DiscordMessages>

If {caelus.name} cannot deliver daily guides updates, "⚠️ Stopped!" will instead appear. Be sure to check your permissions!

## Unset

You can stop {caelus.name} from delivering daily guides updates for whatever reason.

	<DiscordMessage
		author={{ avatar: caelus.avatarIcon, bot: true, username: caelus.name }}
		interaction={{
			author: { avatar: jiralite.avatarIcon, username: jiralite.name },
			command: "/daily-guides unset",
		}}
	>
		Daily guides have been unset.
		<DiscordMessageEmbed
			title="Skykid Server"
			fields={[{ name: "Daily Guides Status", value: `No channel` }, { name: "⚠️ Stopped!" }]}
