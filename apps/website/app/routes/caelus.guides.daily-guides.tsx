				<h2>Setting up daily guides</h2>
				<p>
					Use <code>/configure daily-guides</code>. That's all.
				</p>
				<h2>What will it look like?</h2>
				<p>
					Daily guides are automatically posted at 00:00 PT every day. When you first set up daily
					guides, you might wonder when the next day's will come. The answer is obvious: the next
					day! That's 00:00, in case you <i>really</i> needed that clarity.
				</p>
				<InfoBox>
					Daily guides are distributed at 00:00, but the daily quests need manual input. You can
					expect them to appear between 0-30 minutes.

				<p>
					The time zone in this image is UTC+01:00, which is why the timestamp states 08:00 (Sky is
					8 or 7 hours behind, depending on daylight savings).

			<h2>Seeing daily guides ad hoc</h2>
			<p>
				You can view daily guides at any time by using the <code>/daily-guides</code> command. This
				will respond ephemerally to not interrupt any ongoing conversation.

			<h2>I want to help set daily guides!</h2>
