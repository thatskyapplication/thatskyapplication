# Caelus

Caelus is a Discord bot made especially for [Sky: Children of the Light][thatskygame], the game we all know and love!

## How to maintain

Caelus needs to be updated every now and then to reflect accurate information.

### New season

New season, new spirits. This should be pretty simple.

### Travelling spirits

Every 2 weeks, a seasonal spirit will visit. This is known as a travelling spirit.

1. 2 days prior to the visit, the identity of the spirit will be teased. The travelling spirit's visit date should be updated.
2. If the spirit has never visited before, the maximum winged light count should increase.
3. Once the spirit has arrived, the following need to be done:
   1. Ensure the friendship tree is updated.
   2. Ensure the infographic is updated (the infographics server should distribute this). This should be uploaded to the CDN.
   3. Ensure the marketing video is uploaded to the CDN.

### Returning spirits

Every season (as of 06/03/2023), a group of spirits visit. These are known as returning spirits.

1. Once the spirits have arrived, the respective visit dates them should be updated.
2. If there is a new infographic for these spirits, it should be uploaded to the CDN.
3. The maximum winged light count should increase for any spirit that has never visited before.

### New child of light

A new child of light may be added as part of a season, event, a new map irrelevant to the aforementioned somehow or just a generic update. It doesn't matter how, it just matters that one has been added.

1. The maximum winged light count should increase.
2. Since this is not a wing buff, the number of winged light found in realm it is in also needs to be increased.
